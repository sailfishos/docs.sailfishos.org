## Platform SDK Targets and Toolings

The Platform SDK provides a chroot environment within which ScratchBox2 is available. ScratchBox2 uses qemu emulation to allow architecture-specific binaries to be run on a host machine with a different architecture. For example, it allows a user to run ARMv7 binaries on an x86 host.

Build tools specific to particular version of target operating system are provided as a "tools distribution" (the terminology used in ScratchBox2 documentation varies). In Sailfish OS Platform SDK this is called "SDK tooling".

In order to meaningfully use ScratchBox2 to build software for Sailfish OS devices, a target-architecture root filesystem (commonly known as an "SDK rootfs" but again - the terminology varies) must be installed into the Platform SDK chroot environment. This root filesystem contains build dependencies (including binary executables and libraries) which are needed to build software packages for the target device. It is the most recognized part of a ScratchBox2 target configuration and so the terms "rootfs" and "target" are often used interchangeably. In Sailfish OS Platform SDK this is called "SDK target".

Whenever you enter a ScratchBox2 shell (via `sb2`), you must specify the target which should be activated. Similarly, whenever you use the Sailfish SDK Build script (i.e. `mb2`) to build a package, you must specify the target (which is then activated by ScratchBox2).

## Installing SDK Target and Tooling Tarballs

The latest public releases of Sailfish OS targets (and appropriate toolings) are found here: <https://releases.sailfishos.org/sdk/targets/>

The SDK Assistant tool is available within the Platform SDK chroot environment that simplifies the creation and deletion of ScratchBox2 targets. The most common use for the SDK Assistant tool is to create a new SDK target:
```nosh
sdk-assistant create SailfishOS-latest Sailfish_OS-latest-Sailfish_SDK_Tooling-i486.tar.7z
sdk-assistant create SailfishOS-latest-armv7hl Sailfish_OS-latest-Sailfish_SDK_Target-armv7hl.tar.7z
sdk-assistant create SailfishOS-latest-aarch64 Sailfish_OS-latest-Sailfish_SDK_Target-aarch64.tar.7z
sdk-assistant create SailfishOS-latest-i486 Sailfish_OS-latest-Sailfish_SDK_Target-i486.tar.7z
```

You will always install SDK tooling before SDK targets that depends on that tooling. Removal would be done in the opposite order. Note that while SDK targets are target-cpu specific, SDK toolings are always i486 which is the only supported host platform.

You can also use a direct URL with this tool:

```nosh
sdk-assistant create SailfishOS-latest https://releases.sailfishos.org/sdk/targets/Sailfish_OS-latest-Sailfish_SDK_Tooling-i486.tar.7z
sdk-assistant create SailfishOS-latest-armv7hl https://releases.sailfishos.org/sdk/targets/Sailfish_OS-latest-Sailfish_SDK_Target-armv7hl.tar.7z
sdk-assistant create SailfishOS-latest-aarch64 https://releases.sailfishos.org/sdk/targets/Sailfish_OS-latest-Sailfish_SDK_Target-aarch64.tar.7z
sdk-assistant create SailfishOS-latest-i486 https://releases.sailfishos.org/sdk/targets/Sailfish_OS-latest-Sailfish_SDK_Target-i486.tar.7z
```

This will create three generic (i.e., hardware agnostic) SDK targets, "SailfishOS-latest-armv7hl" for ARMv7, "SailfishOS-latest-aarch64" for ARM64, and "SailfishOS-latest-i486" for i486 platform. Their names are to be used as an argument to `sb2`'s or `mb2`'s `-t` option. The single created SDK tooling "SailfishOS-latest" will be picked up automatically based on its SSU release. If multiple toolings exist with the same SSU release, the selection can be done explicitly with the `--tooling <name>` option.

You can also use this tool for listing your installed toolings and targets:
```nosh
sdk-assistant list
```

And for removing them:

```nosh
sdk-assistant remove <tooling-or-target-name>
```

It also supports updating a target and the tooling used by the target in one step:

```nosh
sdk-assistant update <target-name>
```

This is also the recommented way of updating SDK targets - it can save you from some known issues with the upgrading process in special cases.

See `sdk-assistant --help` for more information.

## Separate Targets

It is often useful to have separate targets for different devices as well as for different architectures, in case some particular package you are building requires low-level, hardware specific packages. An example of this is Hybris-related components. In general, these have to be built against hardware-specific libraries, and so for these it is usually best to create a separate, device-specific target to build your package in.

In most SDK targets, hardware agnostic libraries are provided where possible. For example, Mesa3D libraries provide the OpenGL symbols to avoid requiring hardware-specific libraries to be installed into a generic ARMv7 arch SDK target.
