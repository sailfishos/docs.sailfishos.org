The Sailfish OS platform core packages are situated on top of the hardware adaptation in the Sailfish OS [Architecture](/Reference/Architecture). If you want to add features, improve existing functionality, address security issues, fix bugs, write unit tests or improve documentation in the Sailfish OS platform then this involves developing Sailfish OS core packages related to [Core Areas and APIs](/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs).

At a high level this means interacting with source repositories; using the [Sailfish SDK](/Tools/Sailfish_SDK) to build packages; deploying and testing packages and merging changes back into the source control systems.
