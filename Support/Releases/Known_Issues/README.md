          <td>FIXED.<br />Manual Android app installation from the terminal or file managers is currently not working on the Android 4.4 version of Android AppSupport on Sailfish OS 4.4. To solve this, disable sandboxing for this handler by editing the file <code>/usr/share/applications/apkd-mime-handler.desktop</code> and adding the following to the end of the file:
<div markdown="1">

```ini

Disabled

          This doesn’t affect installing Android apps from the Jolla store, nor other Android stores.

If there are connection problems later on (either WLAN or mobile data), stopping and starting the Android service at “Settings > Android AppSupport” should help. Toggling the connection off and on is another trick to try.</td>

Version <a href="https://developer.sony.com/file/download/software-binaries-for-aosp-oreo-android-8-1-kernel-4-4-nile-v16/">v16</a> works better in this respect. Therefore we would not recommend flashing v17B for the time being if you use WLAN networks in the 5 GHz band. You can reflash the vendor image of your choice by following the instructions <a href="/Support/Help_Articles/Updating_Vendor_Image/"> in here</a>.</td>
