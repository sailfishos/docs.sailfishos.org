## Creating an Ambience

### Gallery app

In the Gallery app when viewing a single image, there is an option to create an Ambience that will use that image as wallpaper and to create the colors automatically derived from that image.

### Theme Color app

There is an app developed by developer Nephros that can automatically create an Ambience on your phone, based on user configuration.

The app is available at [OpenRepos.net](https://openrepos.net/content/nephros/theme-color)

### Manually made RPM package

On OpenRepos.net and in Chum there are several manually created RPM packages that provide an Ambience.

It is also possible to create your own Ambience RPM package.

### Command-line

Set image as the ambience:

```nosh
dbus-send --session --print-reply --dest=com.jolla.ambienced /com/jolla/ambienced com.jolla.ambienced.setAmbience string:"file://home/<user>/Pictures/image.jpg"
```

## Storage of Settings

All ambiences, the built-in ones and those created by the user are managed in an SQLite database at

```
/home/defaultuser/.local/share/system/privileged/Ambienced/ambienced.sqlite
```

Settings of the current active Ambience are located in the dconf database at "/desktop/jolla/theme". These settings can be shown bu running the shell command:

```nosh
dconf dump /desktop/jolla/theme/
```


## Sailfish Browser

### Using a dark Ambience

In the settings for the Sailfish Browser, you can select if the browser should use a light theme, dark theme or follow the Ambience.
The dark mode will only work if the website supports a dark theme.
It is be possible to create an Ambience that will make the browser follow the theme for dark mode.
