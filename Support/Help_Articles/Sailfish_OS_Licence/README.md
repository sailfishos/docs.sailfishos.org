# Devices compatible with Sailfish OS

**Sailfish OS** has been ported to selected devices by Jolla. Community people have ported Sailfish OS to some other devices, too, but that work is unofficial, i.e. Jolla has not been involved and the Sailfish OS licence is not valid on those devices.

Find table of officially supported devices from **[the Supported Devices](/Support/Supported_Devices/)** section. 

We are always looking into porting Sailfish OS into new devices. Please stay tuned to **[Jolla Blog](https://blog.jolla.com/)** and **[Sailfish OS Forum](https://forum.sailfishos.org/)** for the latest information.

 

# How does the licence work

The licence is coupled with the **[Jolla account](/Support/Help_Articles/Accounts_Setup/Setup_Jolla_Account/)** that was used when purchasing the licence. When you sign in to the same Jolla account from an Xperia device, the new licence gets **activated** on that device. If you had signed in to your Jolla account previously then you only need to restart the device to activate the licence. An active licence is also coupled with (the IMEI code of) the device.

One Sailfish OS licence is valid on one device and one Jolla account.

The licence cannot be transferred from one licence group to another. For instance, an Xperia X licence is not valid for Xperia XA2 devices.

  

# Licensed content

Sailfish OS licence makes the so-called _licensed content_ available in Jolla Store, allowing you to **[download](https://shop.jolla.com/downloads/)** and **[install](https://jolla.com/sailfishxinstall/)** those apps and to get OS updates. For an official statement, see the chapter "What you get" at **[Jolla Shop](https://shop.jolla.com/)**.

After you have activated the licence by signing in from your Xperia to this same Jolla account, the licensed content becomes available in the **[category "Jolla"](/Support/Help_Articles/Accounts_Setup/Setup_Jolla_Account/#finding-the-licensed-apps-in-jolla-store)** of the Jolla Store, and Sailfish OS updates appear on the UI (whenever available). Restarting the device may be required in some cases to activate the licence.

  

## What is included in the licensed content?

1.  **Sailfish OS updates**

    Check the availability of updates in "Settings > System > Sailfish OS updates" by pulling down "Check for updates". If you need guidance read the document **[Updating Sailfish OS](/Support/Help_Articles/Updating_Sailfish_OS/)**.
    
2.  **Android AppSupport**

    Allows installing Android app stores which in turn makes it possible to install actual Android apps. The main control item of Android AppSupport can be found at the end of the Settings app.
    
3.  **Microsoft Exchange support**

    Allows signing into one's Exchange account from "Settings > Accounts", after which Exchange will appear in Email, Calendar, and People apps.
    
4.  **Predictive text input**

    Appears as predicted words on top of the virtual keyboard while typing. "Settings > System > Text input" has a button for purging the collected words.
    

It is good to restart the device after installing any of the apps above.

Note that none of these apps will appear as icons in the app grid (after installing them) as they are rather background services. Use "My apps" in the pull-down menu of the Jolla Store app to view what is installed on your device.

  

# What are the Free and Full licences?  

Sailfish OS **Free licence** is a trial version for the Xperia product variants. You can download and install it free of charge to try out Sailfish OS on your Sony device.

Sailfish OS **Full licence** entitles you to use all commercial components (including Android AppSupport) on the Xperia™ 10 III, Xperia™ 10 II, Xperia™ 10, and Xperia™ XA2 devices. The same applies to the Xperia™ X devices, however, the Android support on those devices is the older version that corresponds to Android version 4.4.

This is the list of **[supported devices](https://docs.sailfishos.org/Support/Supported_Devices/)**.

The table "What you get" in Jolla Shop shows **[what the licences cover](https://shop.jolla.com/)**.

  

# Switching from Free to Full licence  

It is simple to upgrade a phone from Free OS to Full OS. You will need to:

1.  Buy the Sailfish OS licence using the same Jolla account that will be used on the phone.
2.  Sign in to this Jolla account on the phone. If done previously then just restart the phone. This activates the licence.
3.  On the phone, go to the menu page "Settings > System > Sailfish OS updates". Pull down to "Check for updates". If you need guidance read the document **[Updating Sailfish OS](/Support/Help_Articles/Updating_Sailfish_OS/)**.
4.  If there is an update available, download and install it using the pulley menu. At the end of the installation, the phone restarts itself. Note that getting an update is not mandatory. All OS releases contain the support of the full licence but the licensed apps remain hidden without an active licence.

You have now the full-blown Sailfish OS on your phone. Thanks to the licence, you are entitled to install the licensed apps and upcoming Sailfish OS releases.
