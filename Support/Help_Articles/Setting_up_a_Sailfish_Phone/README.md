This document is an tutorial for Sailfish OS setup. Precondition is that the SFOS device is flashed.
After the steps described below the the device is fully set up.
Sony Xperia 10 III is used as an example but the same guidelines are good for all phones we have ported Sailfish OS to.

# Register your Jolla account

1. Browse to [this address](https://account.jolla.com/registration/register/) with your computer.
2. Fill in the required information. The email address will be needed if there is a need to reset the password in the future. Also, you will get a confirmation about the account over the email.

# Purchase the Sailfish OS licence

1. Sailfish OS licence can be purchased from [Jolla Shop](https://shop.jolla.com/)
2. Sign in using your Jolla Account registered above.
3. If you have a voucher use that for the purchase.

# Switch the device on for the first time and run the Startup Wizard

Before the Startup Wizard starts, the phone will show a reminder about the unlocked bootloader (please ignore), the Sony logo and the Sailfish logo.

1. Select language
2. Enter new security code
3. Turn on WLAN and connect
4. Select date and time
