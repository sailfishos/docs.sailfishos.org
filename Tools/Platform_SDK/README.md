The Sailfish Platform SDK is the default (documented) option for [Hardware Adaptation Development](/Tools/Hardware_Adaptation_Development_Kit). Further, it can be used for platform development.

Note: Platform development is now more convenient with the regular [Sailfish SDK](/Develop/Platform) through its command line frontend 'sfdk', available on all Linux, macOS and Windows.

# Overview

The Sailfish Platform SDK is a chroot based environment that encapsulates the [Sailfish SDK Toolchain](/Reference/Toolchain) in a portable manner.

Installation is covered in the [Sailfish Platform SDK Installation](/Tools/Platform_SDK/Installation) and the [Sailfish Platform SDK Target Installation](/Tools/Platform_SDK/Target_Installation) guides.

After completing the two installation steps, proceed to learn how to use the SDK to [build software packages](/Tools/Platform_SDK/Building_Packages).
