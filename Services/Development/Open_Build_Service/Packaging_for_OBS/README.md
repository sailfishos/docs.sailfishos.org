This page deals specifically with building packages using the [Open Build
Service](/Services/Development/Open_Build_Service) instance, and tries to cover
all the tasks necessary and some pitfalls along the way.
While this may seem lengthy at first glance, the actual steps involved are not that many.

The high-level overview of the process looks like this:


 1. Get an account on OBS
 1. Create a project, and a package on OBS
 1. Upload the source files, or a special `_service` file to the OBS package
 1. Adjust the .spec file for some peculiarities involved with building on OBS

You can interact with the OBS either on the web interface at [https://build.sailfishos.org](https://build.sailfishos.org), or use the command-line tool, [osc](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:OSC)

**A note about terminology**

*Some terms, like  "repository", "source", "project", "package", have different
meanings depending on context. For example "repo" can mean either a build
environment configuration on OBS, or its corresponding published RPM
repository. But it can also refer to a git repository.*

## Setting up the (Home) Project and creating a Package

To create an account on OBS, follow the instructions on [the OBS front page](https://build.sailfishos.org/).

After creating a user account you are automatically the owner of the so-called "Home Project" named `home:$username`.
You can create various packages in that project and also create sub-projects.

See the official OBS [Beginner ºs Guide](https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/art-obs-bg) for an introduction to OBS in general.

In your project, click on "Repositories", ignore all the checkmarks offered, and select only "SailfishOS latest".
This should be enough to get a basic build environment set up. You can add more repositories and architectures to build against later.

Click "Create Package" in your project if using the Web Interface, or `osc mkpac mypackage` if using `osc` to get started.


## Adding the sources

To get the source files into your OBS Project, either upload them using the Web Interface, or use the `osc` tool:

```sh
cd my:project:mypackage
cp /path/to/mypackage.tar.bz2 .
cp /path/to/mypackage.spec .
osc add *
osc commit
```

There are about three common "packaging formats" used in Sailfish OS
development, which are described under
[Packaging Formats](/Tools/Sailfish_SDK/Building_packages/#packaging-formats):

 - Plain Tarball
 - "Application Repository": `tar_git` with source code repository
 - "Packaging Repository": `tar_git` with upstream submodule

A packaging repository is a git repository which contains just the build
instructions and some other files (like patches) to package software for
Sailfish OS, with the actual source code living in a git submodule of this
repository.  
An "Application Repository" contains the source code itself, e.g. because you
wrote it or forked a git repository.

### Plain Tarball sources

Usually, nothing special needs to be done if you want to build software from a source tarball.
Just populate the OBS Package like below, OBS will pick up both and run the
build. No `_service` file is necessary in this case.

However, you must place a .spec file alongside the source tarball, it cannot be contained within the tarball.

```
application.spec
application-1.2.3.tar.gz
```

*Note: Using a plain tarball is an convenient and quick way to package software
on OBS. Still, you are encouraged to move to a "Packaging Repo" approach for
various reasons, including better revision control and history, easier forking
by others, and considerations about backup/restore.

### `tar_git` sources

`tar_git` is a OBS Service which clones a repository from a public git location,
creates a tarball from it, extracts the build information, and places all those
files into the OBS Package source location. After this it starts to build the package.

To get the service configured on OBS, create a file called `_service` with the
following content, and then upload that file like you would a source file:

```xml
<services>
  <service name="tar_git">
  <param name="url">https://git.example.org/orgname/reponame.git</param>
  <param name="branch"></param>
  <param name="revision"></param>
  <param name="token"/>
  <param name="debian">N</param>
  <param name="dumb">N</param>
</service>
</services>
```

You may want to look at its [source code](https://github.com/MeeGoIntegration/obs-service-tar-git)
for detailed information about `tar_git`.


#### Understanding version mangling performed by `tar_git`

Before starting the build process, OBS will perform certain changes to the
cloned .spec file. This mainly affects the contents of the `%{version}` and
`%{release}` macros.  
(This means you cannot use literal version or revision contents in your build
setup. If you need those, you should parse the values of `%version` and `%release`).

For some examples, see below.

The new `%version` will consist of:
 - if a git hash was specified as `revision` parameter in the `_service`, it will be used as the version
 - if a `branch` parameter was specified in the `_service`, it will be appended to the release name, along with the hash of the git ref, prepended by the letter "g".
 - if no `revision` parameter was specified in the `_service`, but a branch
   name was, it will contain the value of the "nearest" tag in the branch, plus
   the branch name, timestamp, and git ref hash appended to it.

The new `%release` will have the format `X.Y.Z.qual` where:
 - `X` is always 1
 - `Y` is a counter that roughly corresponds to the number of revisions of the OBS package source.
 - `Z` is a counter starting at 1 and increasing each time OBS decides to automatically rebuild the package (usually because a dependency was rebuilt or newly published)
 - `qual` is a string, on OBS ist is set to `bso` (short for `build.sailfishos.org`). `jolla` is also commonly seen.

(This `%release` mangling can be configured using the [`Release`](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_prjconf#Release) configration setting in the OBS project's `prjconf`.)

**About tagging**

It is common practice to leverage the rules above and use git tags as version
specifiers. This is especially true for "Packaging Repositories", where tags
like `X.Y.Z+gitN` signify version `X.Y.Z` of the upstream software, and `N` the
iteration in the packaging repository.

Be aware though that the parser is not perfect. Also, some characters are
disallowed to appear in RPM version strings. So be conservative in the naming
of your tags.

#### Understanding cloning, the source structure, and tarballs generated by `tar_git`

The tarball produced by the service has the following properties:

 - it will be named `_service:tar_git:%{name}-%{version}-%{release}.tar.bz2` (using the changed values explained above)
 - it will contain a directory called `%{name}-%{version}`
 - the directory will:
   - contain the content of the repository, but will not include the `.git` directory (so any git calls in your build process will not function).
   - contain clones of all submodules (usually the "upstream" submodule), also without `.git`
   - the same applies to submodules within submodules.

The service will also extract `rpm` sub-directory from the source repo and
place its contents in the OBS package root.  So the root may end up looking
like this:

```
  _service
  _service:tar_git:foo-1.2+git3.tar.bz2
  _service:tar_git:foo.spec
  _service:tar_git:foo.changes
  _service:tar_git:foo-patchbar.diff
```

**A note about "dumb" packages:**
*You'll notice there is a "dumb" parameter in the service configuration. Setting
this to true switches the behaviour of the service to assume a flat source
structure without any directories and not generate a tarball. 
You may want to use this if your sources are very simple, for example contain only a
single source file and a Makefile.*


**Some Examples**

     - url: https://github.com/orgname/foo.git
     - branch: development
     - revision: *empty*

`_service:tar_git:foo-2.1+development.20240215221650.74.gcafebab.tar.bz2` if the development branch contains a tag called 2.1

     - url: https://github.com/orgname/foo.git
     - branch: development
     - revision: 2.2

`_service:tar_git:foo-2.2+development.20240215221650.74.gacb0e27.tar.bz2`

     - url: https://github.com/orgname/foo.git
     - branch: *empty*
     - revision: 2.2+git3

`_service:tar_git:foo-2.2+git3.tar.bz2`


#### Adjust the spec file: %setup macro and other paths

The name of the tarball must be the first `Source:` line in the .spec file.

You should name it
```specfile
Source: %{name}-%{version}.tar.bz2
```

You can choose a literal string as the name, but you must use the `%{version}` macro.

(Note that `tar_git` will pick up the compression format you want to use from the extension, and will create the tarball accordingly.)

**If you are building a "Packaging Repository"**

Because of the structure of the tarball explained above, usually the `%prep`
section of .spec files will have to be adjusted to use the submodule directory
as the main source.

So if the upstream submodule is called "upstream", the line should look like

```specfile
%prep
%setup -q -n %{name}-%{version}/upstream
```
You can choose a literal string as the name, but you must use the `%{version}` macro.

Similarly, if you change working directories in the build process, be aware of where the actual source code is located relative to `%{_builddir}`: `%{_builddir}/%{name}-%{version}/upstream`

On the other hand, the contents of the `rpm` sub-directory will be in the
package root, not under `rpm` or `%_topdir/SOURCES` during the build. Usually,
this does not affect you though, as OBS sets the internal source path
accordingly, so things like `%SOURCE2` will work as expected.

#### Adjust the spec file: build requirements (BuildRequires).

The building service runner setup used on OBS is more bare-bones than the one
used in the Sailfish SDK, also with regard to the pre-installed packages.  If
you are adapting a .spec file coming from a project developed in the SDK, it is
likely you are missing some build requirements even though the package compiled
fine under the SDK.

Typically this involves the Qt dependencies, so you will need to add lines like the following:

```specfile
BuildRequires:  pkgconfig(Qt5Qml)
BuildRequires:  pkgconfig(Qt5Quick)
BuildRequires:  pkgconfig(Qt5Widgets)
BuildRequires:  pkgconfig(Qt5Xml)
```

## Common errors

To retry after fixing an error, run either `osc service rr` from the locally
checked out OBS package, or "Trigger Services" from the Web Interface.

**ERROR: no packaging in this git clone**

Your project does not contain a .spec file in the `rpm` directory.

**ERROR: couldn't clone foo**

Check the `url` parameter in the `_service` file.
Also, check the settings on your git host. The repository may be set to private.
And be sure to use a clone URL, not a web view of the repo (like git-web).

```xml
  <param name="url">https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/qt6.git</param>
  <param name="branch">gcc</param>
```

*Note: sometimes, if you tried to run the service against a non-public git
repo, failed, and later set the repo to public and try again, the service will
still fail with the same error. You will need to seek assistance from the OBS
maintainers in that case.  
See also [this bug](https://github.com/MeeGoIntegration/obs-service-tar-git/issues/3).

**ERROR: Need single .spec file in rpm**

Your project does contain a directory called `rpm`, but that directory contains more than one .spec file, so `tar_git` gets confused.

There are two possible solutions for that.

 1. delete one of the .spec files in the repo ;)
 1. name the OBS package or the .spec file so their names match exactly. `tar_git` will accept a .spec file that has the same name as the package.

 Note that if you actually want to build all the .spec files, you can either use OBS Links (`_link`), or a [Multibuild](https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/cha-obs-multibuild) setup to achieve that.
 Either create linked Packages that have the same name as the other .spec files or create a `_multibuild` file using the .spec file names as `flavor`:

```xml
<multibuild>
  <flavor>foo</flavor>
  <flavor>bar</flavor>
</multibuild>
```

**ERROR: couldn't determine version from .spec file**

Something is fishy about the `Version:` line in the .spec, or it is missing completely

**ERROR: Source filename in .spec must end in .tar.gz, .tgz, .tar.bz2 or .tar.xz**

The (first) `Source:` or `SourceX:` line in your .spec file is malformed. Be
sure to use one of the file extensions mentioned in the error message.

**Unresolvable: nothing Provides foo**

This is related to `BuildRequires:` in the .spec file.

Reasons include:

 - The dependency is not available in the OBS repositories you have configured in the OBS Project's `meta` configuration.
 - The dependency is available, but does not meet version requirements

If your BuildRequires: uses something like  `pkgconfig()` or `qml()`, try if
specifying the RPM package name (usually `package-devel`) helps. If it does, file an issue with the
package maintainer to include proper RPM `Provides` metadata.

**Blocked: downloading 1 dod packages**

This is a rare error which means one of the build dependencies is known to the
OBS system, but the package can not be accessed for the builder to install.  
You can not fix this yourself, you have to report this to the OBS maintainers.

## Publishing packages

Once you have successfully built your package, you may want to test it.

You can download the build results if you are logged into your account in the
Web Interface, or use `osc getbinaries`.

Another approach is to publish the RPM repository for your project. Publishing
makes all packages available in a repository that can be used by tools like
`zypper` or `pkcon`, and managed by `ssu`.  
Note however there is no access control over such published repositories, and
you can't know who will download your packages. This may or may not be what you want.

To "properly" make your package available to the world, you are encouraged to 
[submit your package to Chum](https://github.com/sailfishos-chum/main#user-content-submitting-actively-maintained-software).


To publish a package, either use the graphical tool in the Web Interface, or edit the Meta information.

Not that Meta can be set globally or a Project, and then overridden per-package.

With `osc`, the commands are: `osc meta -e prj`, and `osc meta -e pkg`


**Example Project Meta configuration:**

Support x64, arm, arm64, build for both arm and arm64, but only publish arm64:

```xml
<project name="home:username:devel:foo">
  <title>Foo</title>
  <description>The Foo suite of software</description>
  <person userid="username" role="bugowner"/>
  <person userid="username" role="maintainer"/>
  <build>
    <disable/>
    <enable repository="4.6_aarch64"/>
    <enable repository="4.6_armv7hl"/>
  </build>
  <publish>
    <disable/>
    <enable repository="4.6_aarch64"/>
  </publish>
  <repository name="4.6_armv7hl">
    <path project="sailfishos:4.6" repository="latest_i486"/>
    <arch>i586</arch>
  </repository>
  <repository name="4.6_armv7hl">
    <path project="sailfishos:4.6" repository="latest_armv7hl"/>
    <arch>armv8el</arch>
  </repository>
  <repository name="4.6_aarch64">
    <path project="sailfishos:4.6" repository="latest_aarch64"/>
    <arch>aarch64</arch>
  </repository>
</project>
```

## Advanced Trickery

### OBS Branches and `tar_git`

One of the drawbacks of using a `_service` file and "Packaging Repository"
setups is that the OBS feature of [branching](https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/art-obs-bg#sec-obsbg-uc-branchprj)
becomes less useful, because your branched package will only contain the
`_service` file, but not any sources to change.

You can of course fork the git repo specified in the `_service` file, and make
changes as usual. But you might not want to do that.

Luckily, there is a workaround:

As branches are links, and the link concept of OBS supports patching the source
files before the build process starts through the `apply` tag of the `_link`
file, we can do some changes locally, create a patch, and add that patch to the
`_link` file.

This is pretty hard to do on the Web Interface alone, so here we assume usage of `osc`.

In this example, we assume what you want to change is the .spec file, but the
same process applies to any file in the packaging repo you can change using a patch.

**Overview:**

 1. Create a branch (or a link) of the package in question
 1. Check out the package sources in "unexpand mode"
 1. Get copies of the extracted .spec file
 1. Set up a local structure we can later use with `diff` to create a patch
 1. Create a patch containing the changes to the .spec file
 1. Edit the `_link` file, using the `<apply>` tag to include our patch


**Step-by-Step**:

```sh
# Create a branch and check it out
osc branch path:to:source:project sourcepackage
# Alternatively, use linking instead of branching:
# osc branch path:to:source:project sourcepackage path:to:my:local:project sourcepackage
osc co home:username:branches:path:to:source:project sourcepackage
cd home:username:branches:path:to:source:project/sourcepackage
# Fetch the _link file:
osc up --unexpand-link
```

Edit the `_link` file to contain
```xml
  <apply name="spec.patch" />
```

Perform whatever changes to the file we want to do, and create a patch:

*Note: the reason we use the a/b directories and don't just leave the spec file
in the package root is that `osc` would actually delete that on the next commit.*

```
# list the contents of the package directory, just so we can confirm the exact name of the extracted .spec file
osc status
# Fetch the .spec file and put it in our local a/b workspace
mkdir a
osc cat _service:tar_git:myapp.spec > a/_service:tar_git:myapp.spec
cp -r a b
# Make some changes:
$EDITOR b/_service:tar_git:myapp.spec
diff -u a b > spec.patch
```

Finally, add the patch file and commit:
```
osc add spec.patch
osc commit spec.patch _link
```

*(Note we add just the `spec.patch` file, and no other files.)*

OBS will now:

 1. check out the sources and .spec file from the upstream repos as usual
 1. apply the path `spec.patch` to these sources
 1. continue the building as usual
