# Overview

Individual installations of Sailfish OS will have access to different collections of software to handle variations in:

  - releases: including testing & development releases
  - hardware: device specific firmware variations
  - geographic area: location specific firmware or software variations
  - licensed software: purchased or otherwise authorised
  - personal: an individual's development or community repositories

SSU provides both on-device software and a cloud service to authenticate devices/users and authorise access to services.

The on-device software registers with the cloud service and manages the zypper/packagekit repositories using the access tokens provided.
