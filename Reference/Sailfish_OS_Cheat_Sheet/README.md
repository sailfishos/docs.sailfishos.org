## Development Commands

The default IP of the device for USB connections is set in Settings \> Developer tools \> USB IP address, which is by default set to `192.168.2.15`. On this page we are referring to this with **device** which one can use alias for with following methods

**A) (RECOMMENDED)** add following to your `~/.ssh/config` file, which also makes the connection easier to handle if you are using multiple developer devices behind same IP address
```ssh-config
# Dev devices which constantly change the ID
Host device
    User defaultuser
    HostName 192.168.2.15
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```

**B)** example to your `/etc/hosts` file, by adding following line there
```
192.168.2.15    device
```

Connect to the device over usb
```nosh
sudo ifconfig usb0 up device
```

Log into the device. Define password in "Settings \> Developer tools \> Remote connection".
```nosh
ssh defaultuser@device
```

Change user to root
```nosh
su       # if on SDK, or
devel-su # if on device
```

Remove changed IP from known_hosts
```nosh
ssh-keygen -R device
```

Update development environment

```nosh
sfdk tools update <target>
```

Build project

```nosh
sfdk config target=<target>
sfdk build # finds the spec under rpm
sfdk --specfile rpm/<package>.spec build # specify spec yourself
```

Copy packages to the device
```nosh
scp ./RPMS/<package>.rpm <user>@device:
```

Listen to system logs
```nosh
devel-su journalctl -fa # Sailfish
devel-su chroot /opt/alien/ /system/bin/logcat -v time # Android apps
```

See also [logcat usage help article](https://jolla.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204110913)

Search log for keyword 'account' ignoring the case
```nosh
devel-su journalctl | grep -i account
```

Open file (apk, media file, vcard, call number, etc.) with appropriate app.
```nosh
xdg-open file # e.g. xdg-open image.jpg
```

List shared library dependencies
```nosh
ldd /usr/lib/qt5/qml/modulepath/libmodule.so
```

List exported symbols
```nosh
zypper in binutils && nm -D /usr/lib/library.so.0
```

Set DConf value
```nosh
dconf write /desktop/meego/background/portrait/picture_filename \'/pathto/wallpaper.jpg\'
```

Print DConf value
```nosh
dconf read /desktop/meego/background/portrait/picture_filename
```

List incoming hardware input events
```nosh
evdev_trace -t
```

Find folders that take more than 100MB of space
```nosh
du -a -x / | awk '{if($1 > 102400) print int($1/1024) "MB" " " $2 }' # root partition
du -a -x /home | awk '{if($1 > 102400) print int($1/1024) "MB" " " $2 }' # home partition
```

List RPM packages that take the most space in the system
```nosh
rpm -qa --queryformat '%{size} %{name}\n' | sort -rn | more
```

Execute QML document.
```nosh
devel-su -p pkcon install qt5-qtdeclarative-qmlscene # install qmlscene
devel-su ln -s /usr/lib/qt5/bin/qmlscene /usr/bin/qmlscene # add symbolic link to path
qmlscene app.qml # run
```

Cleaning up the leftover packages from the system, first refresh the database, then check leftover and lastly remove wanted packages:
```nosh
zypper ref
zypper packages --orphaned
zypper remove --clean-deps PACKAGENAME
```

## Diagnostics

Saving logs is always good
```nosh
devel-su journalctl -a > ~/saved.journal
```

Add -f to contiously listen to the log output:
```nosh
devel-su journalctl -fa
```

The systemd journal is persistent over reboots in devel branch and in release branches if you want to have this behaviour you can edit /etc/systemd/journald.conf and set
```
Storage=persistent
```

By default, the systemd journal throttles output from particularly noisy processes, which can be frustrating when trying to debug an application. Preventing journald from throttling logging from a verbose process - edit /etc/systemd/journald.conf and set
```ini
RateLimitBurst=9999
RateLimitInterval=5s
```

Which will cause systemd to throttle journal output from any process which emits more than 9999 lines of output in any five second interval NOTE: after doing changes for /etc/systemd/journald.conf you should reboot the device.

Various processes can be made more verbose by setting certain environment variables:
```nosh
QT_LOGGING_RULES="*.debug=true"               # any application or service using Qt Categorized Logging
QT_LOGGING_RULES="buteo.*.debug=true"         # Buteo processes and any Buteo sync plugin
SSO_LOGGING_LEVEL=3 SSOUI_LOGGING_LEVEL=3     # Accounts&SSO services
CONTACTSD_DEBUG=1                             # contactsd instant messaging roster synchronisation daemon
QTCONTACTS_SQLITE_TWCSA_TRACE=1 QTCONTACTS_SQLITE_TRACE=1  # qtcontacts-sqlite backend debug output
QT_LOGGING_RULES="org.kde.pim.mkcal.debug=true"            # mKCal debug output
QT_LOGGING_RULES="kf.calendarcore.debug=true" # KCalendarCore debug output
LIPSTICK_COMPOSITOR_DEBUG=1                   # homescreen debug output
```

Qt category logging can be contolled by editing qtlogging.ini. This is an override file - so if that file doesn't exist, just the "default" logging categories are enabled, but if that file does exist, then the categories specified in the file are used:
```nosh
/home/<user>/.config/QtProject/qtlogging.ini
```

There are many categories defined in Sailfish OS such as:
```
org.sailfishos.settings.memorycard
org.sailfishos.browser.core
```
`
Some processes can be made more verbose by installing specific "tracing" packages which configure the service to be more verbose when installed (via `devel-su -p pkcon install <pkgname>`). Some examples include:
```
connman-tracing
bluez5-tracing
connectionagent-qt5-tracing
```

Unfortunately, due to the heterogeneous nature of the packages in Sailfish OS, there is no unified way to enable verbose debug logging, and so the contributor will in some cases have to read the source code to figure out what they need to do to make debug logging work. It may even require setting some #define in source code, and rebuilding the package.

### Home Screen and Compositor diagnostics

Lipstick debugs can be enabled by adding LIPSTICK_COMPOSITOR_DEBUG=1 to /var/lib/environment/compositor/\*.conf.

Now restart lipstick and you have a small box at the bottom of the screen for debugging the top most window. "Dump" button outputs data of the top most window to the journal. "Expose" button shows current windows.

In case screen is locked or/and touch is not responding but you have an access to the device. Top most window can be dumped like:
```nosh
dbus-send --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.nemomobile.compositor.debug /debug org.nemomobile.compositor.debug.dump
```

Similarly use LIPSTICK_COMPOSITOR_TOUCH_DEBUG=1 to debug touch issues with edge swipes.

### Calling diagnostics

Enabling voicecall manager debug logs requires modifying source codes, rebuilding and installing the project packages:
```
voicecall/lib/src/common.h -> #define WANT_TRACE
```

Enabling Phone app logs requires modifying source code line:
```
/usr/share/voicecall-ui-jolla/VoiceCallManager.qml -> enableDebugLog: true
```

### Backup Diagnostics

On the target device go to the command line. Download there [Backup status reporting script](https://github.com/sailfishos/the-vault/blob/master/tools/the-vault-storage-report.sh) and make it executable.
```nosh
curl -o the-vault-storage-report.sh https://github.com/sailfishos/the-vault/blob/master/tools/the-vault-storage-report.sh && chmod a+x the-vault-storage-report.sh
```

Execute the command in privileged mode.
```nosh
devel-su -p ./the-vault-storage-report.sh > /home/<user>/backup-status-report.txt
```

Attach resulting `/home/<user>/backup-status-report.txt` file to your bug report.

### OS Update Diagnostics

Provide the journal of the OS update and /var/log/zypp/history, so developers can debug what went wrong.

### Browser Diagnostics / Debugging

Content moved to [Working with Browser](/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs/Browser/Working_with_Browser)

### Multimedia debugging

There are different debugging mechanisms available depending on the subsystem used:

#### GStreamer

The environment variable [GST_DEBUG](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/basic/debugging-tools.html?gi-language=c) can be used to selectively increase GStreamer logging per element e.g.
```nosh
GST_DEBUG=droidcamsrc:2 jolla-camera
```

to set the debug log level of the camera element to WARN. Other useful values are 1 (Error), 4 (Info) and 5 (Debug).

[DOT file generation](https://developer.ridgerun.com/wiki/index.php/How_to_generate_a_Gstreamer_pipeline_diagram_%28graph%29) is enabled in recent versions of QtMultimedia for camera and media playback. These files describe the GStreamer pipeline at certain points, so you can see which elements are being used and the properties of the data passing between them. They can be transformed into images using 'graphviz'.
```nosh
GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR=/tmp/ jolla-gallery
```

Then on a PC with graphviz installed, this script will turn any DOT files in the current directory into PNG images:
```nosh
DOT_FILES=`find ./*.dot`
for file in $DOT_FILES
do
    dest=`sed s/.dot/.png/ <<< "$file"`
    dot -Tpng $file > $dest
done
```

#### Camera

Although GST_DEBUG can be used to obtain logs for the droidcamsrc element of gst-droid, the droidmedia and Android Stagefright components will log to the android system log. This can be viewed as root by using:
```nosh
devel-su
/usr/libexec/droid-hybris/system/bin/logcat
```

All log lines since boot are displayed, with the oldest lines being removed once a size limit is reached. This means there can be a lot of irrelevant output already collected in logcat before you start debugging. To remove this, call logcat with -c.

### Email / Active Sync (e-mail) debugging

Email logging can be made more verbose by editing configuration files and rebooting:
```nosh
/home/<user>/.config/QtProject/Messageserver.conf  # email, QtMessagingFramework configuration file
/home/<user>/.config/eas-sailfish.conf  # Exchange ActiveSync plugin configuration file
```

For example, to make the Exchange ActiveSync plugin fully verbose, first ensure that journald won't throttle logging output (see the notes on editing `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` [burst limits](/Reference/Sailfish_OS_Cheat_Sheet#diagnostics)) and then ensure that the `/home/<user>/.config/eas-sailfish.conf` file contains the following:
```ini
[logging]
Sailfish.eas=d
Sailfish.easnetwork=d
Sailfish.easwbxml=d
```

Add the following to the same file to have log output saved to `/var/tmp/eas.log`.
```ini
Sailfish.logfile=/var/tmp/eas.log
```

After making changes to the file you'll need to restart the daemon using `systemctl --user restart sailfish-eas` to apply them.

To make the QMF (generic email) component fully verbose, and output logs to the `/home/<user>/qmf.log` file, modify `/home/<user>/.config/QtProject/Messageserver.conf` to contain the following:
```ini
[FileLog]
Enabled=1
Path=/home/<user>/qmf.log

[LogCategories]
IMAP=1
Messaging=1
POP=1
SMTP=1

[StdStreamLog]
Enabled=0

[Syslog]
Enabled=0
```

## Restart System Services

```

## Clearing, Importing and Exporting User Data

### Phone

Install commhistory-tool if not already installed.
```nosh
devel-su -p pkcon install libcommhistory-qt5-tools
```

Clear call logs, run as user
```nosh
commhistory-tool deleteall -calls
```

Add call logs data, run as user
```nosh
commhistory-tool import-json calllogs.json
```

Restart Phone application to see changes in effect.
```nosh
pkill voicecall-ui
```

### Messages

Remove all message conversations, run as user
```nosh
commhistory-tool deleteall -groups
```

Import message data, run as user
```nosh
commhistory-tool import-json messages.json
```

Restart Messages application to see changes in effect.
```nosh
pkill jolla-messages
```

### People

Install vcardconverter if not already installed.
```nosh
devel-su -p pkcon install nemo-qml-plugin-contacts-qt5-tools
```

Import contacts from vCard
```nosh
devel-su -p vcardconverter contacts.vcf
```

Export local contacts to vCard
```nosh
devel-su -p vcardconverter --export contacts.vcf
```
If that doesn't write any contacts, you need to specify the collection. Obtain a list of available collections like so:
```nosh
devel-su -p contacts-tool collections
```
This will print something like the following, use the complete string starting with `qtcontacts:` as the collecion ID:
```nosh
   ID: qtcontacts:org.nemomobile.contacts.sqlite::xxxxxxxx31  Name: aggregate
   ID: qtcontacts:org.nemomobile.contacts.sqlite::xxxxxxxx32  Name: local
   ID: qtcontacts:org.nemomobile.contacts.sqlite::xxxxxxxx33  Name: SIM    
```

### Calendar

Install icalconverter if not already installed
```nosh
devel-su -p pkcon install nemo-qml-plugin-calendar-qt5-tools
```

Import events from iCal
```nosh
devel-su -p icalconverter import calendar.ics
```

Import events using Calendar import page (two possibilities)
```nosh
dbus-send --print-reply --type=method_call --dest=com.jolla.calendar.ui /com/jolla/calendar/ui com.jolla.calendar.ui.importFile string:$HOME/<readableDir>/calendar.ics
xdg-open calendar.ics
```
Both assume that the ICS data are actually in a directory that is visible from inside the jail the calendar application is running into, for instance `$HOME/Documents/`.

Export local calendar events to iCal
```nosh
devel-su -p icalconverter export calendar.ics
```

### Browser

Set the home page.
```nosh
dconf write /apps/sailfish-browser/settings/home_page "'http://jolla.com'"
```

### Media

Transfer content to the device
```nosh
scp *.jpg <user>@device:Pictures
scp *.mp4 <user>@device:Videos
scp *.pdf <user>@device:Documents
scp *.ogg <user>@device:Music
```

### Ambiences

Set image as the ambience.
```nosh
dbus-send --session --print-reply --dest=com.jolla.ambienced /com/jolla/ambienced com.jolla.ambienced.setAmbience string:"file://home/<user>/Pictures/image.jpg"
```

### Homescreen

Reset order of apps in Homescreen launcher.
```nosh
rm /home/<user>/.config/lipstick/applications.menu
```

### Weather

Remove weather locations
```nosh
rm /home/<user>/.local/share/sailfish-weather/weather.json

### Audio Warning Dialog

Change headset audio warning timeout by adding following lines to /etc/pulse/mainvolume-listening-time-notifier.conf.
```
timeout = 1
sink-list = sink.primary
mode-list = lineout
```

Then run:
```nosh
systemctl --user restart pulseaudio.service
```

Now play a song over 1 minute with a normal headset in Media Player to see a warning dialogue.

Reset too-loud volume warning.
```nosh
/usr/bin/dconf write /desktop/<user>/audiowarning true
```

Now play a song over the headset and turn the volume to maximum to see a warning dialogue.

### The Other Half Installation Dialog

## Show settings

Settings (Bluetooth, Accounts, Text input, VPN, etc.) are declared on JSON files found in /usr/share/jolla-settings/entries/

You can launch Settings app in a respective settings page using the following DBus method (opens USB settings page)
```nosh
dbus-send --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=com.jolla.settings /com/jolla/settings/ui com.jolla.settings.ui.showPage string:system_settings/connectivity/usb
```

Works for JSON settings of type "page". Property "path" found in JSON file is used to identify the settings page, which the method takes as an argument.
