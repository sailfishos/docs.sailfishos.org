## Fill your phone with Sailfish OS

GNU/Linux based Sailfish OS natively running on an Android™ phone you like? Yes, it can be achieved when following our HADK porting guide! The document takes you through:

 - The hardware and software requirements
 - Sets up the Sailfish OS Platform SDK and the supporting development environment
 - Instructs on how to craft your phone’s hardware adaptation
 - And finally builds the Sailfish OS ready-to-install image It also contains tips on “getting into” your phone during early stages, as it gradually becomes a glibc-driven Linux gadget

You’ll encounter challenges along the way, as every phone has numerous differences, but our #sailfishos-porters IRC community on oftc.net will be there to help. The following porter’s traits are desired:

 - Linux Kernel and OS knowledge and development
 - Fluency in Git, Github code-review process
 - Android™ Platform SDK
 - Observed [IRC guidelines](/Develop/Collaborate/IRC_Guidelines/)
 - That immense desire to have Linux in your pocket!
