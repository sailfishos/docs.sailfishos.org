Sailfish OS has a vibrant and passionate community following ( o/ everyone!! )

Our [Open Source](/Develop/Open_Source) philosophy and our [heritage](heritage "brokenlink") from Maemo, MeeGo and Mer means that our community has roots (and members) going back over 10 years.

## What's it about?

One of the important motivations for getting involved in the Open Source world is said to be 'scratching an itch' -- the idea that something isn't quite how you'd want it to be so you try to 'fix' it.

Well that itch can come in many areas; historically Open Source has primarily been about software development and whilst it's still the largest area there's a lot more going on:

  - All kinds of documentation: tutorials, user guides, reference information, examples
  - Helping out: talking to people, arranging meet ups, planning
  - Graphic design: making things look good
  - Software development: applications, middleware, systems, websites
  - Quality assurance: managing bugs and faults, triaging

<!-- end list -->

  - And, of course, **using** it: the first step in joining a community is using (and hopefully enjoying!) the product; the second step is finding the community and getting involved in some way.

## Sharing and talking

So how can you talk with like-minded people?

A lot of our community members gather in the [Sailfish OS Forum](https://forum.sailfishos.org); it's friendly and helpful -- and mostly run by users. It's where you'd go to find answers to all kinds of questions or to discuss thoughts with others.

There's a lot of activity on Jolla's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/jollaofficial) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SailfishOS) (from [Jolla](https://twitter.com/JollaHQ/) and the community)

We also have real-time chat on IRC -- there are 'channels' there for general discussions about Sailfish OS as well as more technical channels for chat about developing on Sailfish OS and a very popular channel devoted to porting Sailfish OS to work on other devices. [Read more about connecting to IRC](https://sailfishos.org/community/) and the channels that we're in.

We work with other communities too, such as [Qt](https://wiki.qt.io/Online_Communities) who are important partners for Sailfish OS and a lot of development is done there too.

Finally, just to prove we're not all highly advanced AI's, we meet up in person as well -- there have been community meetups for Jolla, Sailfish OS and other communities in cities all around the globe. There's always something happening at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) and we participate in many other community gatherings too.
